The name of my website is "Password House". Through this website you can save and control all your passwords from one place.

Step 1: Make an account. Step 2: Login. Step 3: Add a Field by clicking on "add field" button on homepage. Step 4: Add a password to the specific field.

You can also add a password from the "add password" option available in the menu. You can see your passwords when you click on the icon of the specific field on homepage. You can also edit passwords, remove passwords and remove fields from the "edit" option available in the menu.
